# IOT-Parking-Detection
Uses camera attached to Raspberry Pi to send pictures of parking lot to Amazon IOT.  The Amazon cloud then will determine what spots are open based on information that was set with a Java program.  The number of parking open can be then accessed with an Alexa skill or the Java program.
